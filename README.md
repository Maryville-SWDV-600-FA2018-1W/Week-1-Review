Repository for Week 1 Programming Exercises

## 8 [temp_converter.py]
Modify the temperature converter we developed in 1.10 Together Project: A Temperature Converter to now convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. A user should now input a temperature in Fahrenheit and the program should output the equivalent temperature in Celsius. Modify the input prompts and the output message as appropriate.

## 9 [bitcoin_converter.py]
Write a program that converts bitcoin to dollars (usd).

One tricky element to currency conversion, whether crypto-currency or otherwise, is that the price is volatile and changing moment to moment. The program should begin by outputting to the user the date and time at which you recorded the conversion rate for bitcoins to usd (e.g., at this moment it is currently $2086 usd to 1 bitcoin), then the user should input the amount of bitcoin they have, and the program should output how much that bitcoin is worth in dollars. For example:

```
As of 8/1/17 at 11:13 am, bitcoin is currently trading at $2086 per bitcoin.
Enter the bitcoin amount: .5
That is worth 1043 us dollars.
```
